# SFML Template



This is my template for a new SFML game.  There is not much to it right now and there isn't a whole lot of room for improving on a simple template. I'll be adding CMake support in the near future and I'll try to keep everything modular so that all you have to do is change a few variables and voila, new game.

## Usage

For now, all there is to compiling the template is:

`g++ -o template sfml_template.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system`
