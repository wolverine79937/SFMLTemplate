# SFML Template

This is my template for a new SFML game.  There is not much to it right now and there isn't a whole lot of room for improving on a simple template. I'll be adding CMake support in the near future and I'll try to keep everything modular so that all you have to do is change a few variables and voila, new game.

## Usage

I only work with Linux at this time, so if you want to run this on Windows or Mac, you are going to have to supply your own modifications as necessary. I would be interested in including the changes necessary to make it work on other operating systems.

CMake is online now.
